The app is still on development.

## The app:
A car pooling service for Sabanci students. The idea is be that if a student owns a car and is traveling to a certain place out from the campus, s/he can post this as a "ride" on the service. The other students then can join one of these posted rides as an alternative way of transportation to shuttles and buses. The app also has a social aspect via ratings, comments, and profile pages.
